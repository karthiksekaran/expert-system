A simple jQuery slideshow weighing in at 4 KB. Simply add a list of your images, surround them with a <code>div</code> with an id of <code>#photos</code> and let the jQuery script take care of the rest.

Two types of navigation exist. Buttons are created dynamically depending on the number of photos added and can be used to cycle through the pictures or if you want to enable left and right navigation, add in a couple of <code>span</code> tags, or any other tags for that matter. Just make sure they have id's of <code>#next</code> and <code>#prev</code>.

View the scripts.js file for more help on slideshow timing settings. Currently set to 4 seconds.
